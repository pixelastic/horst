What is it ?
============

Horst is a simple script to change the fps of a `.srt` file.

Usage
=====

`ruby horst.rb subtitle.srt 25 23.976` will convert `subtitle.srt` from 25 fps
to 23.976 fps and output it.

Notes
=====

As `.srt` file does not contain any information on the fps they are using, this
is your job to find this value. This is usually displayed on the website where
you downloaded the file.
